## Craiglist Sales Prediction
I'm practicing making a model with real data. In this project I created several models to predict the price of a used car and predict whether a used car advertisment is fraud or not by its price.

Initially, this was a group assignment in my college, but I modified it to make it better.

I use data Used Cars Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data).
